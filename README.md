modpack-suggestions
===================

######A list of mods that should be included in the initial release

Place all mods/plugins you want to see here under the appropriate foldr in a file named for your psuedonym. Each mod/plugin listed in your file will count as a vote for that mod/plugin. The top 225 mods (including dependencies) will be considered for addition to the pack. Of those 225, around 185 will be added to the final pack. Plugins will be discussed on the TS.

Mods by Greg or Reika will be ignored, regardless of the number of votes.
